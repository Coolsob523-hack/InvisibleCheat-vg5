Interception and Redirection

CanvasHack is a free bypass that I made so you don’t need to pay. It automatically activates as soon as you install it. It helps hide actions that might get you caught during a test. For example, if you switch tabs, CanvasHack makes everything look normal, so no one knows you left the test.

With CanvasHack, you can do what you need during a test without worrying about being caught.
Request Rewriting

CanvasHack changes the way Canvas tracks your activity during a test.

If Canvas tries to see if you switched tabs or did anything else, CanvasHack makes it look like you’re still focused on the test.
Stealth Mode Activation

Once you install CanvasHack, Stealth Mode automatically turns on. This mode hides your actions from both your teacher and Canvas.

No matter what you do on your computer, CanvasHack makes sure everything looks normal to Canvas.
