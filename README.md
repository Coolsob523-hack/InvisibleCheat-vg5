CanvasHack - Free Bypass for Canvas
Interception and Redirection

CanvasHack is a free bypass that you needed to pay but not anymore. It automatically activates as soon as you install it. CanvasHack hides actions that might get you caught during a test. For example, if you switch tabs, CanvasHack makes everything look completely normal, so no one knows you left the test.

With CanvasHack, you can navigate your test without worrying about being caught.
Request Rewriting

CanvasHack changes how Canvas tracks your activity during a test.

If Canvas tries to check if you switched tabs, opened a new window, or did anything else, CanvasHack makes it look like you’re still focused on the test.
Stealth Mode Activation

As soon as you install CanvasHack, Stealth Mode automatically turns on. This feature hides your actions from both your teacher and Canvas.

No matter what you do on your computer, CanvasHack ensures everything looks normal to Canvas.
